## Description

React-Calculator-KP is a web-based calculator application built using React. It utilizes the `useReducer` hook to manage the calculator's state, making the logic for handling user input and operations both predictable and maintainable. The application supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

Key features include:
- **Responsive Design:** The interface adapts to different screen sizes for optimal usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Clear State Management:** All calculator actions (number entry, operation selection, clearing, and evaluation) are handled through a reducer, ensuring consistent updates and easier debugging.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Buttons are clearly labeled and laid out for intuitive use, with real-time display of input and results.
- **Error Handling:** The app gracefully handles invalid operations, such as division by zero, providing appropriate feedback to the user.

This project demonstrates effective use of React hooks and component-based architecture to build an interactive and reliable calculator.
